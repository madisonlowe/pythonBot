# Action Plan

So I don't forget what I'm intending on doing.

To do, in order:

- Gitignore!
- Hello World and some other test code to figure out what Python's trying to achieve.
- Clone down Andy's Python project to play around with.
- Build bot.
  - Plan this out properly.
  - Basic, easiest achievable goal.
  - Then, pick an actual goal.
- Become a menace.
- Profit.
- Never touch Python again.
