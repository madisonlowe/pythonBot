# Action Plan

So I don't forget what I'm intending on doing.

To do, in order:

- ~~Gitignore!~~
- Build D&D bot.
  - Version 1:
    - Literally just follow a tutorial to figure out how it works.
  - Version 2:
    - Functionality:
      - Timezone checks:
        - Save time zone settings from server members.
        - View overlapping free times in each timezone.
      - Causing problems:
        - Fix the dice.
        - Music functionality but it only plays ambient sounds over covers of Careless Whisper.
- Profit.
- Never touch Python again.

Helpful learning side exercises:

- Hello World and some other test code to figure out what Python's trying to achieve.
- Clone down Andy's Python project to play around with.

## Notes

Learning points to remember:

- Run `python3` to open the interpreter. When you have both versions installed, need to specify the one you want to use.
- Imports only run once per session in the interpreter. Docs say import operations are expensive, so they'll only run once.
- Run `quit()` to close the interpreter.
- See notes in `main.py` on importing and running that code.

Learning exercises to pursue:

- Valerio suggested the fCC introduction to Python as a good place to absorb general knowledge.
- Read more about interpreters. Get the point, don't get the implementation, so focus there.
