# Action Plan

So I don't forget what I'm intending on doing.

To do, in order:

- ~~Gitignore!~~
- Hello World and some other test code to figure out what Python's trying to achieve.
- Clone down Andy's Python project to play around with.
- Build bot.
  - Plan this out properly.
  - Basic, easiest achievable goal.
  - Then, pick an actual goal.
- Become a menace.
- Profit.
- Never touch Python again.

## Notes

Learning points to remember:

- Run `python3` to open the interpreter. When you have both versions installed, need to specify the one you want to use.
- Imports only run once per session in the interpreter. Docs say import operations are expensive, so they'll only run once.
- Run `quit()` to close the interpreter.
- See notes in `main.py` on importing and running that code.

Learning exercises to pursue:

- Valerio suggested the fCC introduction to Python as a good place to absorb general knowledge.
- Read more about interpreters. Get the point, don't get the implementation, so focus there.
